         *    "int" stands for "integers" and holds a 32/64bit value that is by default signed
         *    "float" stands for "floating point decimal" is usually 32bit and signed;

         *    "double" stands for "double precision decimal and is almost always 64bit and signed;
         *        This is essentially a bigger float.
